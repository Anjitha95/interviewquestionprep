# Swap two nibbles in a byte

"""A nibble is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet. There are two nibbles in a byte.
Given a byte, swap the two nibbles in it. 
For example 100 is be represented as 01100100 in a byte (or 8 bits). The two nibbles are (0110) and (0100). 
If we swap the two nibbles, we get 01000110 which is 70 in decimal."""
